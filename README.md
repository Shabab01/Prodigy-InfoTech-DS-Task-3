# Decision Tree Classifier Project

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Decision Tree classifier designed to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The example dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Contents

- **Data Preparation**: A Python script to preprocess and clean the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: A Python script that builds and trains a Decision Tree classifier using the prepared dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: A Python script that evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: A Python script that visualizes the Decision Tree and important features influencing the prediction.

## Dataset

- The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes customer demographic and behavioral data related to a marketing campaign, and the target variable indicates whether a customer subscribed to the product.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).
3. Place the dataset in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the data preparation script to preprocess the data.
5. Run the model training script to build and train the Decision Tree classifier.
6. Run the model evaluation script to assess the performance of the classifier.
7. Optionally, run the visualization script to explore the Decision Tree structure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
